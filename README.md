# Project Choice

Project Choice is a multi-page React Application that provides current information on Abortion Access by state and includes a (capable, but non-functioning) store with branded merchandise for purchase.  There is a contact form to send in suggestions to the developers.  All proceeds go the Planned Parenthood.

## Description:

The user can get information about abortion laws (gestational, minors, insurance, and waiting periods) for any US state.  Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to find the information and resources that apply to them, without having to sift through a lot of noise or, worse, misinformation and stigma from anti-abortion organizations.

A fully functional version is available [here](https://project-choice.herokuapp.com/)
